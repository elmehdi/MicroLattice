# Lattice Development Guide

This document explains the development process of Lattice, including what files were created, in what order, and why.

## Development Process Overview

Lattice was developed in a systematic way, building up from core components to more advanced features:

1. **Project Structure Setup**: Basic directory structure and configuration files
2. **Core Components**: Implementation of the three key technologies
3. **API Design**: Creation of a clean, simple API for data operations
4. **Advanced Features**: Addition of schema evolution and synchronization
5. **Examples and Documentation**: Creation of example scripts and documentation

## Files Created and Their Purpose

### 1. Project Structure Setup

| File/Directory | Purpose |
|----------------|---------|
| `README.md` | Project description and documentation |
| `setup.py` | Python package configuration |
| `requirements.txt` | Project dependencies |
| `src/lattice/__init__.py` | Package initialization |
| `schemas/` | Directory for FlatBuffers schemas |
| `tests/` | Directory for unit tests |
| `examples/` | Directory for example scripts |

These files were created first to establish the basic project structure and configuration.

### 2. Core Components Implementation

#### 2.1 Serialization Layer (FlatBuffers)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `schemas/lattice.fbs` | FlatBuffers schema definition |
| `src/lattice/serialization/__init__.py` | Package initialization |
| `src/lattice/serialization/serializer.py` | Serialization/deserialization utilities |
| `scripts/generate_flatbuffers.py` | Script to generate Python code from schema |

The serialization layer was implemented first as it defines how data is structured and stored.

#### 2.2 Indexing Layer (Succinct Data Structures)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lattice/indexing/__init__.py` | Package initialization |
| `src/lattice/indexing/succinct.py` | Bit-level indexing data structures |
| `src/lattice/indexing/index.py` | Collection indexing functionality |

The indexing layer was implemented next to provide efficient querying capabilities.

#### 2.3 Compression Layer (Zstandard)

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lattice/compression/__init__.py` | Package initialization |
| `src/lattice/compression/compressor.py` | Compression/decompression utilities |

The compression layer was implemented to minimize file size.

### 3. Core API Implementation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lattice/core/__init__.py` | Package initialization |
| `src/lattice/core/lattice.py` | Main LatticeDB and Collection classes |

The core API was implemented to provide a clean interface for database operations.

### 4. Advanced Features

#### 4.1 Schema Evolution

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lattice/core/schema_evolution.py` | Schema versioning and migration |

Schema evolution was added to support changing data structures over time.

#### 4.2 Synchronization

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `src/lattice/core/change_tracker.py` | Track changes for synchronization |

Change tracking was added to support synchronization between client and server.

### 5. Examples and Documentation

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `examples/simple_example.py` | Basic usage example |
| `examples/advanced_queries.py` | Complex query examples |
| `examples/schema_evolution.py` | Schema evolution example |
| `examples/sync_example.py` | Synchronization example |
| `examples/benchmark.py` | Performance benchmarking |
| `LICENSE` | MIT license file |
| `decompress.py` | Utility to decompress .lattice files |

Examples were created to demonstrate various features and use cases.

## Implementation Order and Rationale

### Phase 1: Foundation

1. **Project Structure**: Set up the basic directory structure and configuration files to establish the project foundation.
   
2. **FlatBuffers Schema**: Created the schema first as it defines the data structure that everything else builds upon.
   
3. **Core Data Structures**: Implemented the BitVector and WaveletTree classes for efficient indexing.

### Phase 2: Core Functionality

4. **Serialization Layer**: Implemented serialization/deserialization to convert between Python objects and binary data.
   
5. **Indexing Layer**: Built the indexing system to support efficient queries.
   
6. **Compression Layer**: Added compression to minimize file size.
   
7. **Core API**: Created the LatticeDB and Collection classes to provide a clean interface.

### Phase 3: Advanced Features

8. **Query Capabilities**: Enhanced the indexing layer with more query types (range, regex, prefix, etc.).
   
9. **Schema Evolution**: Added support for evolving schemas over time.
   
10. **Change Tracking**: Implemented change tracking for synchronization.
    
11. **Synchronization**: Added methods to synchronize changes between client and server.

### Phase 4: Documentation and Examples

12. **Basic Example**: Created a simple example to demonstrate basic usage.
    
13. **Advanced Examples**: Created examples for advanced features.
    
14. **Benchmarking**: Added benchmarking to compare performance with other storage methods.
    
15. **Documentation**: Updated the README with comprehensive documentation.

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Created tests for individual components.
   
2. **Integration Tests**: Tested how components work together.
   
3. **Example Scripts**: Used examples as functional tests.

## Future Development

The development process followed a logical progression from core components to advanced features. Future development should continue this pattern, focusing on:

1. **Enhancing Existing Components**: Improving the performance and capabilities of existing components.
   
2. **Adding New Features**: Adding new features like encryption, full-text search, etc.
   
3. **Expanding Documentation**: Creating more comprehensive documentation and examples.

## Conclusion

The development of Lattice followed a systematic approach, building up from core components to more advanced features. This approach ensured that each component was well-tested and integrated before moving on to the next feature.

By understanding this development process, contributors can more easily understand the codebase and contribute to its future development.
